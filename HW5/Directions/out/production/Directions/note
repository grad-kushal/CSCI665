think of it in terms of smaller problems... divide and conquer
What is the cheapest spanning tree using only 1 egde.
    - cheapest one by the cut property.
how to connect everything in the each partition, (this is the smaller sub-problem, we can apply the same algo to this.)

Need to figure out which edge to use as 2nd one if 2 edges from a to b are allowed... then 2nd one which one? not necessarily the next cheapest.




no of nodes with nothing going out and coming in. if 2 or more... no..
if one what?
